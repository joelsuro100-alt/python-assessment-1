Introduction to Data Science - Semester A 5786 - Assignment 1 Clarifications - 25/11/2025

General Clarifications:
- Ensure that the code works for every base from base 2 up to base 16.
- Do not use functions like int() with base, bin(), hex(), oct(), etc.
- Handle edge cases - so that the program does not fail in case of invalid input values.
- In questions 1 and 2, print the result without quotes (i.e., print(value) and not print(f"\"{value}\""))

Specific Clarifications:
- Question 1:
  Input: number as string, base.
  Example: "EC6F80738", 16 → 63467685688
  Additional example: "123456789", 10 → 123456789

- Question 2:
  Input: decimal number, base.
  Example: 15874, 13 → 72C1
  The returned value should be of type string without quotes.

- Question 3:
  Input: 2 numbers in some base, the base.
  Example: "110101", "10001110", 2 → 11000011

- Question 4:
  Input: binary number, desired number of digits in the result.
  Example: "10101", 8 → 11101011

Good luck!!!
